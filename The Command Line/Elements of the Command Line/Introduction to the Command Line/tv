Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-doo,
I've got another puzzle for you.
Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-dee,
If you are wise you'll listen to me.

What do you get from a glut of TV?
A pain in the neck and an IQ of three.
Why don't you try simply reading a book?
Or could you just not bear to look?
You'll get no,
You'll get no,
You'll get no,
You'll get no,
You'll get no commercials.

Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-da,
If you're not greedy you will go far.
You will live in happiness too,
Like the Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-doo,
Do-ba-dee-doo.
