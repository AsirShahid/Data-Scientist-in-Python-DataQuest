Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-doo,
I've got another puzzle for you.
Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-dee,
If you are wise you'll listen to me.

Who do you blame when your kid is a brat
Pampered and spoiled like a Siamese cat?
Blaming the kids is a lion of shame.
You know exactly who's to blame:
The mother and the father!

Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-da,
If you're not spoiled, you will go far.
You will live in happiness too,
Like the Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-doo,
Do-ba-dee-doo.
