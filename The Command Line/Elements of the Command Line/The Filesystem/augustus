Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-doo,
I've got a perfect puzzle for you.
Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-dee,
If you are wise you'll listen to me.

What do you get when you guzzle down sweets?
Eating as much as an elephant eats.
What are you at getting terribly fat?
What do you think will come of that?
I don't like the look of it.

Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-da,
If you're not greedy you will go far.
You will live in happiness too,
Like the Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-doo,
Do-ba-dee-doo.
