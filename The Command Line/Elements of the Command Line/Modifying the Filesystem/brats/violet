Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-doo,
I've got another puzzle for you.
Oompa Loompa, do-ba-dee-dee,
If you are wise you'll listen to me.

Gum chewing's fine when it's once in a while.
It stops you from smoking and brightens your smile.
But it's repulsive revolting and wrong.
Chewing and chewing all day long.
The way that a cow does.

Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-da,
Given good manners you will go far.
You will live in happiness too,
Like the Oompa Loompa do-ba-dee-doo,
Do-ba-dee-doo.
