    "* builtin: Usually refered to as a command or built-in command. Built-in commands are always available in RAM (a special kind of computer memory that is very fast to access, contrary to hard drives). They run quickly and are always available, which is useful when we need to troubleshoot problems in the system.\n",
    "* alias: This is just a different name for a command. We usually use aliases to abbreviate frequently used commands.\n",
    "* function: A function here is similar to what you learned in Python, only it is in a different language (namely the shell language that we happen to be using).\n",
