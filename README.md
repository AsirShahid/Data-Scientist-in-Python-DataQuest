# Data-Scientist-in-Python-DataQuest

I will be using the Anaconda toolkit for Data Science. You can install it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). If you are using Linux, you can download [this installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh), make it executable via `chmod`, and then run the installer. After you go through it, make sure you restart your shell.

From Anaconda, I downloaded Jupyterlab. This can be done by running `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab` in your shell.

I also installed ipython-sql in order to be able to run SQL blocks in Jupyterlab. This can be done by doing `conda install -c conda-forge ipython-sql` in your shell.
