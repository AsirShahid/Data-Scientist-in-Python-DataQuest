    "In the previous lesson we learned how to use joins to combine data from two tables within a database. In reality, most databases have more than 2 tables, so we'll need strategies to be able to write queries to combine data from 3 or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll learn some new techniques to work with the sort of databases that most businesses will use. We'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. Like with our Factbook database, a schema diagram will help us understand the available columns and the structure of the data. Here's a schema diagram for the Chinook database:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/189/chinook-schema.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at all those tables can be overwhelming at first, but generally speaking we will only need to think about the specific tables that have the data we require and their connections. Before we look at some specific tables, let's take a moment to understand the different parts of the schema diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tables names are shown in bold, with the columns in each table listed below.\n",
    "* Each table has one or more columns with shading, which indicates those columns are a primary key. We'll learn more about primary keys in a later lesson, but for now all you need to know is that each row's primary key must be unique.\n",
    "* Relationships between tables are shown using lines between the tables. The lines indicate which columns are related. You may notice that at least one 'end' of the relationship will be a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through this lesson, you may need to refer back to the schema diagram. This is normal, so don't be bothered when that happens. It can also be helpful to write a simple query to check the column names and some example data from any of the tables, for instance:\n",
