    "Welcome to the fundamentals of SQL and databases! In this course, we'll explore and analyze data in SQL through hands-on learning. Before we get started, let's quickly cover why SQL is essential for working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language, or SQL, is more than forty years old, and it is one of the most popular technologies used by data professionals, including data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Understanding the fundamentals of a more general-purpose language like Python or R is critical for working with data, but knowing SQL helps data professionals do more with their data. And if working with R or Python is one of your goals, SQL can help gather insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key reasons why learning SQL will help anybody interested in working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL is everywhere.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the biggest names in tech use SQL — which is pronounced either “sequel” or “S.Q.L.” Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have built their own high-performance database systems, but even their data teams use SQL to query data and perform data analysis. And it’s not just tech companies: companies big and small around the world use SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL enables us to pull data from many sources.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-word situations, data is distributed across many sources. SQL allows us to select specific data and transform it to fit our needs. For example, working with spreadsheets can be difficult if the data we need to answer our question is distributed across many files. SQL allows us to structure our data in a way that makes it accessible from one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL data is structured into multiple, connected tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL is here to stay.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stack Overflow annual Developer Survey, which is the largest and most comprehensive survey of programmers around the world, consistently reveals that SQL is one of the most popular technologies used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out [this Dataquest blog post](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/why-sql-is-the-most-important-language-to-learn/) if you'd like to learn more about why it's important to learn SQL.

    "So, let's learn about the language itself and how you can use it to query data."

    "Before we get started, let's learn a little about databases. Don't worry: you'll start practicing in the next screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with data stored on our computers, we load the data from files like spreadsheets (and text files in several different formats). Working with files solely on our computer is fine most of the time, but we run into problems when we consider a few questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What if the data is too big to fit into a single spreadsheet file?\n",
    "* What if you share the data with team members and keep it updated?\n",
    "* What if there's sensitive information in your data that needs protection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, these problems already have a solution: the database. A database structures data just like a spreadsheet by organizing data in different tables, which are comprised of rows and columns. In the example below, we see a table in a spreadsheet where each row represents a chess player and each column gives information about the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/252/spreadsheet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A database can store much more data more securely than a spreadsheet or a text file. Unlike simply opening a spreadsheet, we actually have to \"ask\" for data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We primarily interact with a database using a database management system (DBMS) — a computer program to help users interact with data by giving the computer instructions through the DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin learning SQL with the DBMS SQLite. SQLite is a lightweight DBMS, and it is the most popular database in the world. Move on to the next screen to start learning some SQL code!"

    "Congratulations on running your first SQL query in this course! The output was the entirety of the recent_grads table.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",

    "You may have noticed that SELECT and FROM use uppercase letters. This isn't required, but it makes your code easier to read.\n",

    "Since we often read code more often than we write it, it's common for coders to follow certain conventions, so that programs written by different people look the same, reducing the amount of work it takes to read them.\n",

    "In these courses, we'll be following this SQL Style Guide. We suggest that you explore it as you progress through the course.\n",

    "In this lesson, we became familiar with a dataset stored in a SQLite table by learning how to craft basic SQL queries. The kind of queries we learned here and that we'll keep studying for the next few courses are one of four types of SQL commands we can give:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data query language\n",
    "* Data definition language\n",
    "* Data control language\n",
    "* Data manipulation language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course and the next, we'll focus on data query language (DQL). DQL is the part of SQL that allows users to extract data from databases. Data engineers use the remaining types of instructions to create and maintain databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We rarely linked to SQLite documentation, because it's a bit challenging to understand when you're just beginning. Sites like W3 Schools and SQL ZOO are more friendly for looking up SQL commands.\n",
    "* We learned about clauses, statements, keywords, and operators in SQL. Here's a diagram describing the difference between each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/252/sql_components.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to quickly iterate on queries as you think of new questions is the appeal of SQL. The SQL workflow lets data professionals focus on asking and answering questions, instead of lower-level programming concepts. There's a clear separation of concerns between the engine that stores, organizes, and retrieves the data and the language that lets people interface with the data without worrying about the underlying mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the scale of data has increased, engineers have maintained the SQL interface while changing the database engine. This allows people who need to ask and answer questions easily transfer their SQL experience, even as database technologies change. For example, the Presto project lets you query using SQL but use data from database systems like MySQL, from a distributed file system like HDFS, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, we'll learn how to compute summary statistics and perform reductions on the same data in SQL."
