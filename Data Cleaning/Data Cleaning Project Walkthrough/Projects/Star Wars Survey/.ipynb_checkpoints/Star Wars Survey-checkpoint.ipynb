    "Welcome to the Star Wars Survey guided project! Guided projects help you apply the concepts you learn in Dataquest lessons and start building a portfolio. In this in-browser coding experience, you'll get help and hints to bridge the gap between learning on our platform and applications in the real world.\n",

    "Doing well on a guided project is a bit different from doing well in a Dataquest lesson, where there's a \"correct\" answer. Guided projects help you create solutions on your own (although we'll be there to help!).\n",

    "In this project, you'll work with Jupyter notebook and analyze data on the Star Wars movies. When you're finished, you'll have a notebook you can either add to your portfolio or expand on your own.\n",
